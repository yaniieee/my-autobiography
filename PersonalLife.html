        <h2>Growth</h2>
        <p>Through self-reflection and life experiences, I’ve grown into someone who embraces change and seeks new opportunities to learn. There is no impossible if you want to make things possible. I learned how to accept everything as a challenge and grow with them by learning how to accept it. Theirs lot of things that change because of the surrounding people who think so highly of themselves just because they have everything and yes I just gave them a “idgaf” look and “okay suit yourself dear if that’s what you want.”</p>

        <h2> Aspiration </h2>
        <p> Kindness, honesty, and commitment to growth are values that guide nor aspire me to make the best choices and shape the way I see the world and always move forward because there is no point in staying depressed if you don’t make a move for yourself. My career and passion may not align together, but I know that God is with me, he has a better plan for me and I need to work hard inorder for this to happen and have a faith in him.</p>

        <h2>Present</h2>
        <p>My story is far from over, but I embrace every chapter with gratitude knowing that each step has brought me closer to discovering who I want to be.</p>
