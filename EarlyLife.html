        <h2> Introduction </h2>
        <p>I’m writing my autobiography as my reflection on the path I’ve done so far, the experiences I challenged and the lessons that shape who I am. I’ll be sharing to you on how my life changed so far right now.</p>
        <p>I was born in Basak Caimitohan Lapu-Lapu City, Cebu and based on my mom’s story there are lots of adult who doesn’t like me but some also like me. My mom brought me in Tabina Zamboanga Del Sur, and I was raised by my grandparents, the three of us siblings. It was fun being with them and we are surrounded by great people that we can call “kuya” and “ate” which my mom’s cousin son’s and daughter(I think?). The school are fun no bullies and no haters it was a peaceful environment but pretender’s and manipulators are there(char). There was this time when I was playing while my sister was cleaning the classroom and as I wait for her to come out because we always go home together. Our school is like on top of a mountain so from highway there's a road to go to my school is a slant road and after slant road a flat road and when you reach the gate we have lots of way before we go to the flag ceremony ground but before you go to the flag ceremony each way’s to reach there is also a room and a gym. So theirs a one time while I was waiting for my sister to finish cleaning the room, I played a round and round until I felt like the world is spinning, so my friend suggested me to go down the slant road, we have a flat road that is also slant, so I did go down by rolling then I go back to the ground using the stairs near grade 6 and go back down using grade 6 stairs because I thought I don’t feel dizziness anymore, so an accident happened as I was trying to keep my posture to go down properly and unfortunately as I stepped on the stairs the grounds are near my feet, so I stepped on it and fall down because I didn’t know it’s still far, so I had that accident in front of the grade 6 students who’s taking the exams, so I got up like nothing happened and hiding at the gym but  all grade 6 students go out just to check on me and told to do this and that to treat my wounds and my friends told my sister about it and then the grade 6 student get back to the room and only one person left like he’s literally waiting, and I think he had a crush on my sister that time, so she came, and then she came running to me without her shoes on, I feel bad for her because of my clumsiness. So all of us came back, and I behave as she continued cleaning It really felt like the whole campus knew about the accident because our school are rumored to be the home of ghost’s. Our section even saw a monster and a child together but as I think about it, I think it was just a monkey. My childhood was all filled with laughter, curiosity,  and valuable moments with my family and friends. Not until my mom brought me back to Cebu again there’s a lot of unfortunate happening.</p>

        <h2>Moments</h2>
        <p>One of the most defining moments in my life was when I  am the top 1 of my class during preschool year because I want to make my mom and my grandparents proud. Showcasing my dance skill, arts, sports, and in class was my top priority because I want to show them what I achieved and when I told my mom over the phone that I received a medal during my senior year, and she said that “of-course you’re a bright student, and I’m so proud of you always, while you were with us, you always amaze me of your intelligence. You know how to make things uncapable, capable on your own way, you’re my daughter” and that really hit me hard and thoughts come like I should have done more during my junior high year if I have someone who’s proud than my mom. I literally forgot about them though we call but just when we have a load and signal there is bad, so the timing is really important. That’s when I told myself that I will study hard and get you or pay them a visit. I missed my grandparents handing me money like we’re some drug dealer just to buy the food we want.</p>

        <h2>Challenges and lesson</h2>
        <p>Life hasn’t been smooth sailing, but through struggle, I’ve learned resilience, empathy, and the value of resilience. No matter how many hardships I face I always think about “I can do this” and “I need to visit my grandmother and my grandfather’s grave” My first parents. I accept the challenges and learn from them because I know  what I want, and I want to achieve things my own way</p>
